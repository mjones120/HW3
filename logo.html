<!--4. Define the following flexbox css rules
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/:
a. display: flex- this is a container that enables flex context for its children
b. flex-direction -this defines the direction in which flex items are put into containers
c. flex-wrap - this feature allows flex items to be wrap onto more than one line since by default the items always fit onto one line
d. justify-content/align-items - it helps distribute extra free space when all the items on the line are infelxible
e. align-content - This is the default way that flex items move across the line. -->
